### Reinforced Learning to Solve a Rubik's Cube

## Problem Statement
Can I train a Deep Neural Network to solve a rubik's cube?

## Background 
The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ern≈ë Rubik. Originally called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by Ideal Toy Corp.

Machine Learning tactics have been used to build a multitude of unsurpervised and supervised models and their applications are endless. With this project I hope to learn a bit more about how methods like the one mentioned earlier create models that can solve prolems in a timely manner.

## Data Collecting
For data collection I decided to generate training samples starting from a solved state and taking random actions.
The method I chose to use is a method called Autodidactic Iteration (ADI) ,developed by UC Irvine Statistics and CS alumni, which is essentially an interactive surprised learning procedure that trains a neural network.

## Conclusion
While optimizing for both computation time and moves made, it would average around 30 moves.

Compared to a human, between 50 - 60 moves, and the human world record sitting at 20 moves.

Computers say that the almost 100% of solves are within 16-19 moves.

The time it took to produce these models felt never ending and tweaking the models each time would take me days just to produce results.
Due to the long computation times and my choice to change methods half way through my capstone period I wasn't able to produce the model I was hoping for.
Not all files for this code are uploaded to due to the reasons mentioned, I hope that in the near future I'll be able to fine tune this more and have a more polished project.
